# SpreadsheetGear code samples for C# in Jupyter Notebooks #
Microsoft uses the name Polygot Notebooks. Previously Microsoft called them .NET Interactve Notebooks

These code samples have been tested in [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

## Packages used by Spreadsheetgear code samples for C# in Jupyter Notebooks: ##
*   **[SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreadsheetGear/9.1.44-beta)** - A Nuget package that is the primary SpreadsheetGear library and provides a core set of APIs to read, write, manipulate and calculate workbooks, build charts, format worksheets and cells, and more. Learn more about SpreadsheetGear products on its [Features Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Features) and [Comparison Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Compare).

## Options to view and run SpreadsheetGear code samples in this repository: ##
