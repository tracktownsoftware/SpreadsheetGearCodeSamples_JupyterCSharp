# SpreadsheetGear code samples for C# in Jupyter Notebooks #

These code samples have been tested in [Visual Studio Code (VSCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Microsoft uses the term [Polyglot Notebooks](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-polyglot-notebooks-harness-the-power-of-multilanguage-notebooks-in-visual-studio-code/) for Jupyter Notebooks that use the .NET Interactive kernel. In addition to C#, Polyglot Notebooks support additional languages such as F#, Powershell, Javascript, HTML Mermaid and SQL. 

See [SpreadsheetGear code samples for Python in Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/tracktownsoftware/SpreadsheetGearCodeSamples_JupyterPython) for Jupyter Notebooks that use the Python kernel. 

## Package dependencies ##
*   **[SpreadsheetGear Engine for .NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpreadsheetGear/9.1.44-beta)** - A Nuget package that is the primary SpreadsheetGear library and provides a core set of APIs to read, write, manipulate and calculate workbooks, build charts, format worksheets and cells, and more. Learn more about SpreadsheetGear products on its [Features Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Features) and [Comparison Page](https://www.spreadsheetgear.com/Products/Compare).

## Options to view and run code samples in Visual Studio Code ##
- Open a Github Codespace in a browser based Visual Studio Code editor (no installation required)
- Open a Github Codespace in your local Visual Studio Code editor (no other installation required) 
- Clone this repo and use its DevContainer configuration in your local Visual Studio Code editor (you need Docker Desktop to host the DevContainer)
- Clone this repo and in use your local Visual Studio Code editor with all requirements installed
