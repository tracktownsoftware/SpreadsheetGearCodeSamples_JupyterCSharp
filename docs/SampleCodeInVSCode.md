6. You will see your new Codespace for this repo load into a browser based Visual Studio Code editor. Wait a few more minutes as required VSCode extensions are downloaded and installed. You will not see this setup delay when opening an existing Codespace.
7. Keep in mind Github free accounts only allow 2 Codespaces. You can delete and create Codespaces for repos as needed.  

## Open a Github Codespace in your local VSCode editor (no other install required) ##
1. Once you have an existing Github Codespace (see previous option), you can choose to open it in the browser or your local installed VSCode editor.
